        <h2>About Myself</h2>

        <p>My name is Ojobor Jude Ikechukwu, a passionate and curious learner with a deep interest in technology and software development. I enjoy exploring new tools and techniques that improve how we interact with computers and the internet. I am always eager to acquire practical digital skills that can help me grow in my career and make a positive impact in the tech community.</p>

        <p>In class, I learned several essential foundational skills for web development. I discovered how to download and install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on a Windows computer. I also practiced two methods of opening a folder in VS Code: one by right-clicking a folder and selecting “Open with Code,” and the other by navigating through the File menu within the VS Code environment. Additionally, I learned how to quickly generate basic HTML boilerplate code using the shortcut <strong>Shift + 1</strong> followed by pressing <strong>Enter</strong>, and how to save files with the <code>.html</code> extension. These skills are vital for setting up and building professional websites.</p>
